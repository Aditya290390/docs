Welcome to the Smallest AI API. This page walks you through creating credentials and sending a verified request to Smallest AI.


## 1. Create an API Key

Authentication is handled using API keys. You must create a new API key from [console/apikeys](https://console.smallest.ai/apikeys).

## 2. Make Your First Request

You can use the CLI (Command Line Interface) or Python-SDK to make the request.

### CLI
Send requests to the API with an `Authorization` header that includes your API Key using the Bearer token format.

```shell
curl -X POST 'https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/synthesize' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -o output.wav \
  -d '{
        "text": "How to generate professional documentation?",
        "output_format": "wav"
      }'
```


### Python

Install the latest version of the Smallest AI SDK (Software Development Kit).

```bash
pip install smallestai
```

Set your API key as an environment variable for security:
> Do not embed API keys in client-side code.
```bash
export SMALLEST_AI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```


```Python getting-started.py
from smallestai.waves import WavesClient
import os

def main():
    client = WavesClient(api_key=os.environ["SMALLEST_AI_API_KEY"])
    client.synthesize(
        "How to generate professional documentation?",
        save_as="output.wav"
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now you can use any audio player to play your generated audio.
