# Overview

> Fastest real-time speech-to-text transcription over HTTPS using the Lightning ASR API.

The Waves Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) stack processes audio via `https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_text` and returns low-latency transcripts with configurable languages, formats, and pricing tiers suited for enterprise deployments. 

## Introduction & use cases

- **Customer analytics** – process recorded calls or meetings to unlock insights, QA, and compliance workflows.
- **Productivity tooling** – convert lectures, podcasts, and field audio into searchable text for downstream AI systems.

## Feature highlights

- **Lightning POST API** – upload raw audio or reference hosted files; receive transcripts with word-level timing.
- **30+ languages** – automatic language detection (`language=multi`) or ISO 639-1 codes (`en`, `es`, `hi`, etc.).
- **Rich metadata** – optional diarization, age/gender prediction, emotion scores, file metadata, and utterance segmentation.
- **Security & controls** – Bearer-token authentication, enterprise subscription tiers.
- **Low latency** – streaming pipeline tuned for ~64 ms end-to-end processing latency.

Use `language=multi` to auto-detect across the full list or specify one of the codes above to pin the model to a single language.

## Typical workflow

1. **Capture audio** – record 16 kHz mono PCM or reuse archived media.
2. **Submit to Lightning** – pick raw bytes or JSON URL workflows.
3. **Receive transcripts** – parse the JSON payload for `transcription`, `word_timestamps`, and `utterances`.
4. **Enrich & store** – use metadata to power analytics, search, and compliance dashboards.
