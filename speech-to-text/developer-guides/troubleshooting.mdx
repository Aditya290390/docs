## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Request refused or timeout">
    **Symptoms**

    - HTTPS request fails immediately
    - Frequent timeout or TLS errors

    **Fixes**

    1. Verify API key validity and enterprise subscription status.
    2. Allow `https://waves-api.smallest.ai` through firewalls or proxies.
    3. Implement retries with exponential backoff to avoid rate limits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No transcription results">
    **Symptoms**

    - Audio uploaded but no `transcription` field
    - Response returns an empty string

    **Fixes**

    1. Ensure `format` and `sample_rate` match the actual audio encoding.
    2. Confirm the audio contains speech (not silence or heavy noise).
    3. Break very long recordings into smaller files before uploading.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High latency or delays">
    **Symptoms**

    - Request takes longer than the audio duration
    - Slow responses under load

    **Fixes**

    1. Use smaller audio chunks (0.5–1.0 s).
    2. Minimize client-side processing before sending frames.
    3. Tune `speechEndpointing` or `speechEndThreshold` for faster cutoff.
    4. Prefer 16 kHz mono unless high-fidelity audio is required.

## When to contact support

Collect request IDs, timestamps, language parameters, file metadata, and API responses when reporting issues. The support team can correlate logs only when they have session metadata, audio duration, and workspace IDs.
