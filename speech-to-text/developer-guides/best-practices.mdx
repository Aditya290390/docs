# Best practices

> Keep Lightning ASR accurate and reliable with consistent audio prep and clean HTTPS requests.

## Audio quality optimization

### Sample rate selection

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="16 kHz (recommended)" icon="microphone">
    Best balance of accuracy and bandwidth for speech-driven experiences.
  </Card>
  <Card title="8 kHz" icon="phone">
    Ideal for telephony audio; minimal bandwidth and acceptable for call centers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="44.1 kHz" icon="music">
    Use when transcripts must capture music-heavy or broadcast content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="48 kHz" icon="video">
    Maximum quality for video/multimedia workflows, higher resource cost.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Format guidelines

```javascript
const optimalConfig = {
  audioEncoding: "linear16",
  audioSampleRate: "16000",
  audioChannels: "1",
  addPunctuation: "true",
};
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="linear16">
    **16-bit Linear PCM (recommended)**

    - Uncompressed, predictable bandwidth
    - Highest accuracy across languages
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="opus">
    **Opus compressed**

    - Great for browsers/mobile
    - Slightly higher latency due to compression
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="flac">
    **FLAC compressed**

    - Lossless archival audio
    - Larger chunks, higher CPU cost
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="mulaw">
    **μ-law encoded**

    - Telephony standard (8-bit)
    - Lowest bandwidth, lower fidelity
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Request checklist

- Split long recordings into manageable segments to keep upload times reasonable.
- Retry POST requests with exponential backoff when you hit `429` or transient `5xx` responses.
- Log request IDs, filenames, durations, and language settings for easier debugging.
- Proxy browser uploads through your backend so API keys never touch client code.

## Parameter tuning

- `language` – set explicitly for non-English audio; use `multi` only when you can’t predict the language.
- `sample_rate` – match the actual audio rate to prevent resampling artifacts.
- `punctuation` – enable for customer-facing transcripts; disable for downstream NLP pipelines.
- `redact` – mask PCI/PII inline (e.g., `redact=card,ssn`) to stay compliant.
- `vad` – emit voice-activity events to power turn detection and analytics.
