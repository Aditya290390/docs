title: Why Self-Host?
description: Understand when self-hosting our models makes sense for your organization

## Overview

Using Smallest as a managed service has many benefits: it's fast to start developing with, requires no infrastructure setup, and eliminates all hardware, installation, configuration, backup, and maintenance-related costs. However, there are situations where a self-hosted deployment makes more sense.

## Performance Requirements

Certain use cases have very sensitive latency and load requirements. If you need ultra-low latency with voice AI services colocated with your other services, self-hosting can meet these requirements.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ideal Use Cases" icon="bolt">
    - **Real-time AI voicebots** requiring sub-100ms response times
    - **Live transcription systems** for broadcasts or conferences
    - **High-volume processing** with predictable costs
    - **Edge deployments** with limited internet connectivity
  </Card>

  <Card title="Key Benefits" icon="gauge-high">
    - Colocate speech services with your application infrastructure
    - Scale independently based on your specific workload patterns
    - Zero network latency to external APIs
    - Consistent performance regardless of internet conditions
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Zero Network Latency

When you self-host, your speech services run within your own infrastructure—whether that's the same data center, VPC, or even the same machine as your application. This eliminates the round-trip time to external APIs entirely.

      <td style={{ padding: '12px 16px', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff' }}>100-200ms</td>

For real-time voice applications like AI agents, every millisecond matters. Self-hosting keeps your latency predictable and minimal, regardless of where your users are located or the state of the public internet.

### Security & Data Privacy

One of the most common use cases for self-hosting Smallest is to satisfy security or data privacy requirements. In a typical self-hosted deployment, no audio, transcripts, or other identifying markers of the request content are sent to Smallest servers.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Ideal For" icon="shield-halved">
    - **Healthcare applications** requiring HIPAA compliance
    - **Financial services** with strict data governance
    - **Government and defense** applications
    - **Enterprise environments** with air-gapped networks
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data Privacy Guarantees" icon="lock">
    - Your audio data never leaves your infrastructure
    - Transcripts remain entirely within your control
    - No data stored beyond the duration of the API request
    - Self-hosted deployments do not persist request/response data
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What Data is Reported?

<Note>
In a typical self-hosted deployment, no audio or transcript data is sent to Smallest servers. Only usage metadata is reported to the license server for validation and billing purposes.
</Note>

**Metadata reported:**
- Audio duration and character count
- Features requested (diarization, timestamps, etc.)
- Success/error response codes

**Never reported:**
- Audio content
- Transcripts or synthesis output
- Personally identifiable information

### Cost Optimization

For high-volume or predictable workloads, self-hosting can be more cost-effective than per-request API pricing.

  <thead>

      <th style={{ padding: '12px 16px', textAlign: 'left', fontWeight: '800', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff', borderTopLeftRadius: '8px' }}>Benefit</th>

      <td style={{ padding: '12px 16px', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff' }}>Infrastructure-based pricing, not usage-based</td>

      <td style={{ padding: '12px 16px', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff' }}>Predictable autoscaling maximizes resource efficiency</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ padding: '12px 16px', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff', borderBottomLeftRadius: '8px' }}><strong>Long-term savings</strong></td>
      <td style={{ padding: '12px 16px', border: '0.5px solid rgba(209, 213, 219, 0.2)', color: '#ffffff', borderBottomRightRadius: '8px' }}>Significant cost reduction for sustained high volumes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

### Reliability & Grace Periods

Self-hosted deployments include built-in resilience against unforeseen network errors and temporary outages. The deployment won't suddenly stop working due to a transient network issue or external service disruption.

This means:
- **Continuous operation** during network interruptions or license server maintenance
- **Protection against unforeseen errors** — your services keep running while issues are resolved
- **Time to recover** — grace periods provide a buffer to restore connectivity without impacting your users

<Note>
The License Proxy supports **grace periods** that allow your deployment to continue operating even if connectivity to the Smallest license server is temporarily lost.
</Note>

## Customization & Control

Self-hosting provides complete control over your deployment:

  <Accordion title="Resource Allocation" icon="sliders">
    Optimize compute resources for your specific workload patterns. Allocate more GPU power during peak hours and scale down during off-peak times.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Version Control" icon="code-branch">
    Upgrade on your schedule. Test new versions in staging before production rollout. Roll back instantly if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Network Isolation" icon="network-wired">
    Deploy in private networks, VPCs, or air-gapped environments. Full control over ingress and egress traffic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integration Flexibility" icon="plug">
    Direct integration with your monitoring, logging, and alerting infrastructure. Custom Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and alerting rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## When to Use Managed Service Instead

Self-hosting isn't always the right choice. Consider the managed Smallest API if:

- You're building a prototype or MVP
- Your audio processing volume is low or unpredictable
- You don't have DevOps resources to manage infrastructure
- You need to get started quickly without infrastructure setup
