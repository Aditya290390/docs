## Cluster Requirements

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Kubernetes Version" icon="dharmachakra">
    **v1.19 or higher**
    
    v1.24+ recommended
  </Card>

  <Card title="Node Count" icon="server">
    **Minimum 2 nodes**
    
    - 1 CPU node (control plane/general)
    - 1 GPU node (Lightning ASR)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Total Resources" icon="microchip">
    **Minimum cluster capacity**
    
    - 8 CPU cores
    - 32 GB RAM
    - 1 NVIDIA GPU
  </Card>

  <Card title="Storage" icon="hard-drive">
    **Persistent volume support**

    - 100 GB minimum capacity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
We recommend using L4 or L40s GPUs for the best performance.

## Network Requirements

Ensure the following ports are accessible within the cluster:

| Port | Service | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| 7100 | API Server | Client API requests |
| 2269 | Lightning ASR | Internal ASR processing |
| 3369 | License Proxy | Internal license validation |
| 6379 | Redis | Internal caching |

### External Access

The License Proxy requires outbound HTTPS access to:
- `console-api.smallest.ai` (port 443)

<Warning>
Ensure your cluster's network policies and security groups allow outbound HTTPS traffic from pods.
</Warning>

## Storage Requirements

### Storage Class

Verify a storage class is available:

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
```

You should see at least one storage class marked as `(default)` or available.

### For AWS Deployments

If deploying on AWS EKS, you'll need:

- **EBS CSI Driver** for block storage
- **EFS CSI Driver** for shared file storage (recommended for model storage)

<Tip>
See the [AWS EKS Setup](/v4.0.0/content/on-prem/kubernetes/aws/eks-setup) guide for detailed setup instructions.
