## Summary
Best Overall Model: 🏆 **smallestai_streaming** delivers the lowest average Word Error Rate (WER) across English, Hindi, and code-switched audio, while also handling noisy and disfluent speech effectively. It edges out deepgram_nova3_streaming in amost every category, making it the top choice for multilingual and mixed-context scenarios.

Note: AssemblyAI’s streaming ASR does not support Hindi or code-switched transcription, it is English-only in streaming mode.

## Test Dataset - Categories Overview   

The internal test dataset comprises a diverse set of speech samples designed to evaluate ASR performance across real-world conditions, including language variation, background noise, and natural conversation artifacts.

- **Code-Switched**: Hindi-English mix within the same conversation.  
  Example: *"यह movie बहुत अच्छी थी but ending थोड़ी confusing लगी"*  
  - **How it was created:** Generated using our in-house TTS on curated code-switched text, ensuring natural alternation between languages in the same sentence or utterance.  

- **Hindi**: Traditional Hindi in Devanagari.  
  Example: *"हमने उसका जन्मदिन मनाया"*  
  - **How it was created:** Recorded and synthesized from native Hindi speakers using varied topics, from casual conversations to descriptive narratives.  

- **English**: Standard English in Latin script.  
  Example: *"jovial joggers joyfully joined jogging jaunts justifying joyful jolliness"*  
  - **How it was created:** Includes tongue twisters, technical/scientific terminology, and diverse domains such as technology, healthcare, and finance to evaluate robustness across vocabularies.  

- **Disfluency**: Audio containing hesitation words, repetitions, and self-corrections.  
  Example: *"see uh uh i i when i went i thought the food was not good"*  
  - **How it was created:** Real recordings of people speaking naturally, sourced from **Atoms** call recordings to capture genuine in-the-wild speech patterns.  

- **Noisy**: Audio with background interference, low quality mics, or multiple speakers.  
  - **How it was created:** Real recordings from **[Atoms](https://smallest.ai/voice-agents)** call data with actual customer interactions, ambient sounds, and overlapping speech, replicating real-world ASR deployment conditions.
