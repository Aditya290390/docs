## Overview

Waves API implements concurrency limits to ensure fair usage and optimal performance across all users. Understanding these limits is crucial for building robust applications that integrate with our services.

## What is Concurrency?

**Concurrency** refers to the number of simultaneous requests that can be processed at any given moment. In the context of Waves API:

- **1 TTS request concurrency**: Only 1 Text-to-Speech request can be actively processed at a time per account
- This applies to all TTS endpoints including Lightning, Lightning v2, Lightning Large, and streaming variants

## How Concurrency Works

### HTTP API Requests

- Each HTTP API call (POST request) counts as **1 concurrency unit** while being processed
- Once the request completes and returns a response, the concurrency slot is freed
- If you attempt to make a second HTTP request while one is already being processed, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error

### WebSocket Connections

- You can establish up to **5 WebSocket connections** simultaneously (5 × concurrency limit)
- However, only **1 concurrent request** can be processed across all WebSocket connections
- Additional requests sent through any WebSocket while one is being processed will be rejected with an error

## Monitoring Your Usage

### Dashboard Monitoring

Check your usage patterns in the Waves dashboard to:

- Monitor request patterns
- Identify peak usage times
- Plan capacity requirements

## Parallel Conversational Bots

For conversational applications, you can potentially support approximately **4x your concurrency limit** in parallel conversations. This is based on the typical speaking patterns where users don't speak continuously.

### How It Works

- **Concurrency limit**: 1 active TTS request
- **Potential parallel conversations**: ~4 conversations simultaneously
- **Reasoning**: In natural conversation, users speak intermittently with pauses between responses
  <Warning>
    This is a **rough estimate** and may fail when multiple conversations
    simultaneously request TTS generation. Your application must handle 429
    errors gracefully when the actual concurrency limit is reached.
  </Warning>

## Upgrading Limits

If your application requires higher concurrency limits, please contact our support team to discuss enterprise plans with increased limits.

<Note>
  Concurrency limits are account basis. If you are using multiple models, all
  models share the same concurrency limit.
