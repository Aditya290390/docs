Pronunciation dictionaries allow you to customize how specific words are pronounced in your text-to-speech synthesis. This is particularly useful for:

- Brand names, product names, or proper nouns
- Technical terms or acronyms
- Words that should be pronounced differently than their standard pronunciation
- Non-English words in English text (or vice versa)

## How Pronunciation Dictionaries Work

A pronunciation dictionary is a collection of word-pronunciation pairs that you create and manage through the Waves API. Each dictionary has a unique ID that you can reference in your TTS requests to ensure consistent pronunciation across your applications.

### Key Concepts

- **Word**: The text that appears in your input
- **Pronunciation**: The way the word is written out in normal words to show how it sounds (not IPA)
- **Dictionary ID**: A unique identifier for your pronunciation dictionary that you use in TTS requests

## Creating a Pronunciation Dictionary

### Step 1: Create Your Dictionary

First, create a pronunciation dictionary with your custom word-pronunciation pairs:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/pronunciation-dicts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "items": [
      {
        "word": "API",
        "pronunciation": "ay-pee-eye"
      },
      {
        "word": "GitHub",
        "pronunciation": "git-hub"
      },
      {
        "word": "SQL",
        "pronunciation": "sequel"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "64f1234567890abcdef12345",
  "items": [
    {
      "word": "API",
      "pronunciation": "ay-pee-eye"
    },
    {
      "word": "GitHub",
      "pronunciation": "git-hub"
    },
    {
      "word": "SQL",
      "pronunciation": "sequel"
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": "2023-09-01T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Step 2: Save the Dictionary ID

**Important:** Save the returned `id` from the response. You'll need this ID to reference your pronunciation dictionary in TTS requests and for future updates or deletions.

```javascript
const dictionaryId = "64f1234567890abcdef12345"; // Save this!
```

## Managing Your Pronunciation Dictionaries

### List All Dictionaries

Retrieve all your pronunciation dictionaries:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/pronunciation-dicts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Update a Dictionary

Modify an existing pronunciation dictionary:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/pronunciation-dicts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "64f1234567890abcdef12345",
    "items": [
      {
        "word": "OpenAI",
        "pronunciation": "open ay eye"
      },
    ]
  }'
```

### Delete a Dictionary

Remove a pronunciation dictionary:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/pronunciation-dicts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "64f1234567890abcdef12345"
  }'
```

## Using Pronunciation Dictionaries in TTS Requests

Once you have created a pronunciation dictionary and obtained its ID, you can use it in your TTS requests by including the `pronunciation_dicts` parameter. This parameter accepts an array of dictionary IDs, allowing you to use multiple pronunciation dictionaries in a single request:

### Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-v2/get_speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Welcome to Waves API! Our TTS service integrates with GitHub.",
    "voice_id": "your_voice_id",
    "pronunciation_dicts": ["64f1234567890abcdef12345"],
    "sample_rate": 24000,
    "speed": 1.0,
    "language": "en"
  }'
```

### Using Multiple Dictionaries

You can also use multiple pronunciation dictionaries in a single request by providing an array of dictionary IDs:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning-v2/get_speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "Our API uses PostgreSQL and integrates with GitHub for CI/CD.",
    "voice_id": "your_voice_id",
    "pronunciation_dicts": [
      "64f1234567890abcdef12345",
      "64f9876543210fedcba09876"
    ],
    "sample_rate": 24000,
    "speed": 1.0,
    "language": "en",
    "output_format": "wav"
  }'
```

## Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete example showing the full workflow from creating a dictionary to using it in synthesis:

```python
import requests
import json

# Your API configuration
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
BASE_URL = "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Step 1: Create pronunciation dictionary
pronunciation_data = {
    "items": [
        {"word": "PostgreSQL", "pronunciation": "post-gres"},
        {"word": "Redis", "pronunciation": "red-iss"},
        {"word": "Kubernetes", "pronunciation": "koo-ber-net-ees"},
        {"word": "nginx", "pronunciation": "engine-x"}
    ]
}

# Create the dictionary
response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/pronunciation-dicts",
    headers=headers,
    json=pronunciation_data
)

dict_data = response.json()
dictionary_id = dict_data["id"]
print(f"Created pronunciation dictionary with ID: {dictionary_id}")

# Step 2: Use the dictionary in TTS synthesis
tts_request = {
    "text": "Our infrastructure uses PostgreSQL, Redis, Kubernetes, and nginx.",
    "voice_id": "your_voice_id",
    "pronunciation_dicts": [dictionary_id],  # Use the dictionary ID here
    "sample_rate": 24000,
    "speed": 1.0,
    "language": "en",
    "output_format": "wav"
}

# Generate speech with custom pronunciations
audio_response = requests.post(
    f"{BASE_URL}/lightning-v2/get_speech",
    headers=headers,
    json=tts_request
)

# Save the audio file
with open("speech_with_custom_pronunciations.wav", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio_response.content)

print("Speech generated with custom pronunciations!")
```

### Tips for Creating Pronunciations

1. **Break down complex words**: For multi-syllable words, separate syllables with hyphens

   - "Kubernetes" → "koo-ber-net-ees"

2. **Spell it how it sounds**: Write words the way you want them spoken, even if it’s not standard spelling

   - "SQL" → "sequel"
   - "API" → "ay-pee-eye"

3. **Stay consistent**: Use the same style across your dictionary (e.g., always use hyphens for syllables).

4. **Test and refine**: Generate a small dictionary first, test the pronunciations, and adjust until they sound natural.

## Best Practices

### Dictionary Management

- **Keep dictionaries focused**: Create separate dictionaries for different domains (e.g., one for technical terms, another for product names).
- **Combine multiple dictionaries**: Use the array format to apply multiple pronunciation dictionaries in a single TTS request.
- **Update regularly**: Add or refine pronunciations as your vocabulary grows.

### Pronunciation Quality

- **Verify pronunciations**: Listen to the output to confirm it matches expectations.
- **Consider context**: Some words may have multiple valid pronunciations—pick the one that makes sense for your use case.
- **Language consistency**: Ensure pronunciations match the language setting of your TTS requests.

### Performance Considerations

- **Cache dictionary IDs**: Store dictionary IDs in your application to avoid repeated API calls.
- **Batch updates**: When possible, update multiple pronunciations in a single API call.
- **Monitor usage**: Track which dictionaries are actively used in production.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Dictionary not found**

- Make sure you’re using the correct dictionary ID and that the dictionary hasn’t been deleted.

**Pronunciations not applied**

- Verify that the dictionary ID is included in your TTS request.
- Ensure the words in your text match exactly (case-sensitive) with your dictionary entries.
- Confirm the pronunciation is written in plain text (not IPA).

**Unexpected pronunciations**

- Simplify your spelling.
- Test with shorter words first and adjust gradually.

### Error Responses

The API will return specific error messages for common issues:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid request body",
  "details": [
    {
      "code": "invalid_type",
      "expected": "string",
      "received": "undefined",
      "path": ["items", 0, "pronunciation"],
      "message": "Required"
    }
  ]
}
```
