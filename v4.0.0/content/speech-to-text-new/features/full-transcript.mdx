title: 'Full Transcript'
description: 'Get cumulative transcript from real-time WebSocket API'
---

The Full Transcript feature provides a cumulative transcript that accumulates all transcription text received up to the current point in the session. This is useful for maintaining a complete transcript of the entire conversation or audio stream.

## Learn How to Enable Full Transcript

Set `full_transcript=true` in your Lightning STT WebSocket API query parameters when connecting.

### Real-Time WebSocket API

```javascript
const url = new URL("wss://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_text");
url.searchParams.append("language", "en");
url.searchParams.append("encoding", "linear16");
url.searchParams.append("sample_rate", "16000");
url.searchParams.append("full_transcript", "true");

const ws = new WebSocket(url.toString(), {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

## Output Format & Field of Interest

The `full_transcript` field contains the complete transcription text accumulated from the beginning of the session. This field is only included in responses where `is_final=true`, ensuring you receive the complete transcript only when a segment is finalized.

## Sample Response

```json
{
  "session_id": "sess_12345abcde",
  "transcript": "[CREDITCARDCVV_1] and expiry [TIME_2] slash 34.",
  "is_final": true,
  "is_last": true,
  "full_transcript": "Hi, my name is [FIRSTNAME_1] [FIRSTNAME_2] You can reach me at [PHONENUMBER_1] and I paid using my Visa card [ZIPCODE_1] [ACCOUNTNUMBER_1] with [CREDITCARDCVV_1] and expiry [TIME_1].",
  "language": "en",
  "languages": ["en"]
}
```

## Response Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `full_transcript` | string | Complete transcription text accumulated from the start of the session. Only present when `full_transcript=true` query parameter is set AND `is_final=true` |
| `transcript` | string | Partial or complete transcription text for the current segment |
| `is_final` | boolean | Indicates if this is the final transcription for the current segment |

## Use Cases

- **Conversation logs**: Maintain a complete transcript of an entire conversation or session
- **Call recording summaries**: Build full transcripts for recorded calls
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track the complete transcription progress during live streams
- **Analytics**: Analyze complete conversation context rather than individual segments
