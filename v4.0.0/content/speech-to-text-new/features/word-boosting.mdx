Word Boosting (also known as Keyterm Prompting) allows you to improve Keyword Recall Rate (KRR) for important keyterms or phrases by up to 90%. This feature helps ensure accurate transcription of industry-specific terminology, product names, company names, and specialized jargon.

## Learn How to Enable Word Boosting

Add `keyterm` parameter in the query string to specify important terms along with a probability value (0 to 1) that indicates the importance or boost level for that term.

The format is: `keyterm=TERM:PROBABILITY`

Where:
- `TERM` is the keyterm you want to boost
- `PROBABILITY` is a value between 0 and 1 indicating the boost level (higher values = higher priority)

### Pre-Recorded API

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_text?model=lightning&language=en&keyterm=nacho:0.5&keyterm=bacon%20cheeseburger:0.4" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SMALLEST_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
  --data-binary "@/path/to/audio.wav"
```

### Real-Time WebSocket API

```javascript
const url = new URL("wss://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_text");
url.searchParams.append("language", "en");
url.searchParams.append("encoding", "linear16");
url.searchParams.append("sample_rate", "16000");
url.searchParams.append("keyterm", "nacho:0.5");
url.searchParams.append("keyterm", "bacon cheeseburger:0.4");

const ws = new WebSocket(url.toString(), {
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
  },
});
```

## Case Sensitivity and Formatting

Keyterms preserve formatting (including case and punctuation) which helps control how proper nouns, product names, or company names are transcribed.

Best practices for keyterm formatting:

- For proper nouns (names, brands, titles): Use appropriate capitalization (`Waves`, `iPhone`, `Dr. Smith`)
- For non-proper nouns: Use lowercase (`tretinoin`, `algorithm`, `protocol`)

When smart formatting is applied to the transcript, words that start sentences may be automatically capitalized regardless of keyterm formatting.

## Using Multiple Keyterms

You can pass in multiple keyterms in your query string by repeating the `keyterm` parameter for each keyterm with its probability value:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url "https://waves-api.smallest.ai/api/v1/lightning/get_text?model=lightning&language=en&keyterm=nacho:0.5&keyterm=bacon%20cheeseburger:0.45&keyterm=crispy%20seasoned%20fries:0.4" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $SMALLEST_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: audio/wav" \
  --data-binary "@/path/to/audio.wav"
```

For multi-word phrases, URL-encode spaces as `%20`.

## Expected Improvements

Word Boosting can significantly improve recognition accuracy and confidence scores for industry-specific terminology. Typical improvements include:

| Source | Before Recognition | After Recognition |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| nacho stack double crunch taco | "macho stack" | "nacho stack double crunch taco" |
| bacon cheeseburger | "bake in cheeseburger" | "bacon cheeseburger" |
| account number | "a count number" | "account number" |
| billing department | "building department" | "billing department" |
| technical support | "tech nil call support" | "technical support" |

## Best Practices for Keyterm Selection

When choosing keyterms, consider the following guidelines to maximize accuracy:

**Good Keyterm Examples:**

- **Industry-specific terminology**: Medical terms (`tretinoin:0.5`, `diagnosis:0.4`), technical jargon (`escalation:0.45`, `API:0.35`)
- **Product and company names**: Brand names (`Waves:0.5`, `iPhone:0.5`), service names, competitor names
- **Multi-word phrases**: Common phrases in your domain (`account number:0.4`, `customer service:0.35`)
- **Proper nouns**: Names, brands, titles with appropriate capitalization (`Dr. Smith:0.5`)
- **Common non-proper nouns**: Use lowercase (`algorithm:0.3`, `protocol:0.3`, `refill:0.4`)

**What to Avoid:**

- **Generic common words**: Very common words that are rarely misrecognized (`the`, `and`, `is`) - don't boost these
- **Overly broad terms**: Words that appear in many contexts without specific meaning
- **Excessive keyterms**: Focus on the most important 20-50 terms with appropriate probability values
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Ensure capitalization matches your desired output
- **Extreme values**: Avoid using only 1.0 or only 0.0 - use a range to differentiate importance levels
