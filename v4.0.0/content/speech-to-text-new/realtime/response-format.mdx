For every chunk sent on the WebSocket, the server responds with a json message. It provides users control over response handling, which they can structure according to their needs. Users can choose to read quick responses with lower accuracy or wait until the server sends sizable responses which are highly accurate. 

## Example Response

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "status": "success",
  "session_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "transcript": "Hello, how are you?",
  "is_final": false,
  "is_last": false
}
```

## Response Fields

- **`type`**: Message type identifier, set to `"transcription"` for transcription results.
- **`status`**: Status of the transcription request, typically `"success"` for valid responses.
- **`session_id`**: Unique identifier for the transcription session.
- **`transcript`**: Partial or complete transcription text for the current segment.
- **`is_final`**: Indicates if this is the final transcription for the current segment. `false` indicates a partial/interim transcript; `true` indicates a final transcript.
- **`is_last`**: Indicates if this is the last transcription in the session. `true` when the session is complete.

### Optional Fields

The following fields may be included in responses under certain conditions:

- **`full_transcript`**: Complete transcription text accumulated so far (will be included when `is_last=true`).
- **`language`**: Detected language code (typically included when `is_final=true`).
- **`word_timestamps`**: Array of word-level timing metadata (only included when `word_timestamps=true` in query parameters).

## Handling Responses

We maintain an interval server side buffer, which collects user sent chunked audio. Once this buffer reaches a specific size, the server sends a special response with the `is_final` parameter set to `true` which contains transcription of user audio collected since the last such response.

### `is_final = true`

We recommend processing responses of this kind for optimal transcription accuracy. The internal buffer size is caliberated in a way which optimizes response times and accuracy.

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "status": "success",
  "session_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "transcript": "Should I do it? ",
  "is_final": true,
  "is_last": false,
  "full_transcript": '',
  "language": "en"
}
```

- Additionally, the `language` field is set to the specified language, or the detected language if the language parameter is set to `multi`. Other responses will not include the `language` field.
- The `full_transcript` is non-empty if the user sends the end token `{"type":"end"}` to signal end of session.

### `is_final = false`

These are interim transcript responses sent for each chunk. They provide quick feedback for low latency usecases.

```json
{
  "type": "transcription",
  "status": "success",
  "session_id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001",
  "transcript": "Yeah.",
  "is_final": false,
  "is_last": false
}
```

-  These responses nat provide inaccurate results for the most recent words. It occurs when audio for these words are not fully sent to the server in the respective chunk.
